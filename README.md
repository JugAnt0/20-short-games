# Python Mini-Games Collection (20 Games)

This project started as a way for me to practice Python without relying on tutorials.
Instead of building one large application, I chose to create many small games and combine them into a single program.
Each game helped me understand a different concept, from simple conditionals to managing game logic.
The focus was learning by building, testing, and fixing my own mistakes.

## How It Works

* The entire project runs from a single Python file
* When launched, a numbered menu appears in the terminal
*The player selects a game by entering its number
*Instructions are shown in the terminal for each game

## Games Included

* Secret Santa — Randomly assigns gift recipients while keeping pairs hidden

* Two Truths and a Lie — Players guess which statement is false

* Mafia — Turn-based social deduction game with hidden roles

* House Decor Simulator — Generates decor ideas based on room type

* Fortune Telling Service — Produces randomized fortune messages

* Outfit Inspiration Generator — Suggests outfits with short descriptions

* Sheep Story Game — Choice-based story with multiple paths

* Multiplication Power Game — Displays powers of a chosen number

* Balloon Pop — Risk-based game where the balloon may burst

* Story Adventure — Branching story with different endings

* Dice Race — Race against the computer using dice rolls

* Trivia Game — Multiple-choice general knowledge quiz

* Treasure Hunt — Grid-based guessing game

* Simon Says — Memory game with growing sequences

* Memory (Pairs) — Matching game focused on recall

* Math Quiz — Random arithmetic challenges

* Guess the Word — Word guessing game with limited attempts

* Rock, Paper, Scissors — Classic game against the computer

* Tic Tac Toe — Player vs Player or Player vs Computer

* Hide and Seek (Numbers) — Guess the hidden number within a range

## What I Learned

Designing programs using functions instead of long scripts
Managing control flow and user input in terminal applications
Using randomness to create replayable logic
Handling invalid input without crashing the program
Structuring a multi-game project inside a single file
Turning a Python script into a distributable executable
